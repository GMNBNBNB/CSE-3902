3902 team 6 project


We have designed three levels, where level 1 and level 2 are adventure levels, and level 3 and level 4 is extra levels.

for MainMenu, PauseMenu and VictoryMenu:

We created three pages, including the main page, the pause page and the Victory page. 
The main page contains three levels, and players can choose from any of the three levels. 
After entering the game, you can switch to the pause page by pressing P, the pause page includes returning to the main menu and continuing the game. 
After completing the level, the Victory screen appears, which includes a restart and return to the main menu.

In level 3:

Block/obstacle controls: Use the keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown.
Item controls: Use the keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown.
Enemy/NPC (other character) controls: Use the keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or NPC is currently being shown.
Other controls: Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.
For each level, you can use Escape to exit the level, return to the main menu, and use Q to quit the game.
Use M to mute game.

For level 1:

We achieved collisions with enemies and blocks. Implements interaction with items and blocks. 
The map is completely created. Mario has 3 health points, and every time he collids with an enemy, he loses 1 health. 
The enemy can also attack; Each time Mario collides with a Fireball, he loses 1 health. Mario can eat coins on the map. 
There are dungeon levels, where Mario can enter the dungeon by pressing the S key while standing on the pipe, and exit the dungeon by pressing the B key at the exit.

for level 2:
Based on level 1, we added more monsters and plants, and Mario can get bigger after eating the flowers and add 1 health. 
And the larger Mario can send fireballs.
