3902 team 6 project


We have designed three levels, where level 1 and level 2 are adventure levels, and level 3 is a test room.

In level 3:

Block/obstacle controls: Use the keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown.
Item controls: Use the keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown.
Enemy/NPC (other character) controls: Use the keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or NPC is currently being shown.
Other controls: Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.
For each level, you can use Escape to exit the level, return to the main menu, and use Q to quit the game.

For level 1:

We achieved collision with enemies and blocks.
Interaction with items and blocks is implemented.
The map is not fully created; we only created a few blocks and items for testing.
Mario has three health points, and each time he collides with enemies, he will lose one health point.
Enemies can also attack; each time Mario collides with a fireball, he will lose one health point.
Mario can eat coin in the map.
