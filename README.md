3902 team 6 project


We have designed three levels, where level 1 and level 2 are adventure levels, and level 3 is a time level.(we delete test room)

for MainMenu, PauseMenu and VictoryMenu:

We created three pages, including the main page, the pause page and the Victory page. 
The main page contains three levels, and players can choose from any of the three levels. 
After entering the game, you can switch to the pause page by pressing C, the pause page includes returning to the main menu and continuing the game. 
After completing the level, the Victory screen appears, which includes a restart and return to the main menu.

For level 1:
We achieved collisions with enemies and blocks. Implements interaction with items and blocks. 
The map is completely created. Mario has 3 health points, and every time he collids with an enemy, he loses 1 health. 
The enemy can also attack; Each time Mario collides with a Fireball, he loses 1 health. Mario can eat coins on the map. 
There are dungeon levels, where Mario can enter the dungeon by pressing the S key while standing on the pipe, and exit the dungeon by pressing the B key at the exit.

for level 2:
Based on level 1, we added more monsters and plants, and Mario can get bigger after eating the flowers and add 1 health. 
And we added fog, which brightens the area when Mario has explored it. To make it easier, we didn't make the fog particularly dark.

In level 3:
Level 3 is a time-limited level, which states that the player must complete it by a specified time, or they will fail. 
These include very difficult fireball attacks and blocking blocks.

For Block:
We added a variety of different blocks, including the mushroom block, which Mario bumps into will pop up the mushroom, 
and Mario can eat the mushroom to become bigger and gain a life. Star block: When Mario hits a block, a star will pop out, and Mario can be invincible for 10 seconds if he eats the star. 
Flower block, Mario hit the block will pop flowers, Mario eat the flower can cause a fireball.

For CheatCode:
The game has added cheaters, which currently include increasing the player's health through "increase health". 
Transforms the player into the invincible state "invin". Change the player's speed "speed"
Then enter the speed number you want, and the "jumps" to change player's jump ability
